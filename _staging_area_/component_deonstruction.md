Now, for separating the components into individual files:

1. Create a new folder called `components/ai-chat` in your project structure.

2. Create separate files for each component:

   - `ChatMessage.tsx`
   - `ConversationPanel.tsx`
   - `InputPanel.tsx`
   - `OptionsPanel.tsx`
   - `ChatHistoryPanel.tsx`
   - `AIChat.tsx` (main component)

3. Move each component into its respective file, along with any necessary imports.

4. In the `AIChat.tsx` file, import all the other components:

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { ChatMessage } from './ChatMessage'
import { ConversationPanel } from './ConversationPanel'
import { InputPanel } from './InputPanel'
import { OptionsPanel } from './OptionsPanel'
import { ChatHistoryPanel } from './ChatHistoryPanel'

// ... rest of the AIChat component
```

5. Create an `index.ts` file in the `components/ai-chat` folder to export all components:

```typescript
export { AIChat } from './AIChat'
export { ChatMessage } from './ChatMessage'
export { ConversationPanel } from './ConversationPanel'
export { InputPanel } from './InputPanel'
export { OptionsPanel } from './OptionsPanel'
export { ChatHistoryPanel } from './ChatHistoryPanel'
```

6. Update any imports in your main pages to use the new structure:

```typescript
import { AIChat } from "@/components/ai-chat"

export default function Page() {
  return <AIChat />
}
```

This structure will help you organize your components and make the code more maintainable. Remember to move any shared types or utilities to separate files as well, if needed.
