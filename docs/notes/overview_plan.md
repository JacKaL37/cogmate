# FEATURES

Tool toggles:

I think we aren't looking for `autonomous` agent workflows in this application
- but we may want `directed` agent workflows.
  - user can say "give it to this agent, and then to this agent" if, say, you want a second agent to critique the work of the first agent. 
  - prompt sequestration: the "another pair of eyes" effect 

Monaco editor for artifacts. 
- should populate several context providers:
  - current line
  - current highlighted selection
  - [ continue on copying the crap they did in ]

Kiln for fucking around(?)

Prompt browser: hierarchical (project prompts) + atomic (mix-in prompts)

hierarchical:
- user defined prompt tree

mix-ins: 
- ad-hoc singletons
- e.g., default will be to have the `vibe: cogmate` and `skill: wiki refrence`


Prompts: 
- name
- prompt
- tool list (?)
- attachments (?)
  - static files you want to show up every time
  - ? how brows pdf?
  - text good tho!

# TECH
